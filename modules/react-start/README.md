# React Consumer for Pact Demo

This project is a **React consumer application** that demonstrates **consumer-driven contract testing** using [Pact](https://pact.io). It fetches data from an API and validates its behavior against a contract.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the React module:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phil-rice/tscontractdemo.git
cd tscontractdemo/modules/react
yarn install
yarn start
```

Note that this requires the api to be running to work correctly. If you just get the message loading...,
then the api is not running.
